### Assignment

<ol>
<li>Follow the instructions atop the [Recipes project](/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes) to set up a GitHub repository for this project (of course you'll need to change the title).</li>
<li>Create a blank HTML document.</li>
<li>Come up with a plan -- which sections of the page should be grouped together (e.g. the navigation bar vs the video vs the sidebar etc)?</li>
<li>Create empty semantic HTML elements to enclose those sections.</li>
<li>
Use basic CSS to size and position them appropriately on the page.<br>
It may be helpful to make their backgrounds different colors so you can see the different sections.<br>
Don't forget to use your browser's developer tools (right click on the page, click "inspect element")!
</li>
<li>Now let's start filling in those divs with content by creating the navbar.</li>
<li>Watch [this YouTube video on embedding a YouTube video in a webpage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJIrF4YjHfQ&feature=emb_title).</li>
<li>Embed a YouTube video of your choice into your page.</li>
<li>Next, build the sidebar section where previews of suggested videos show up.<br>Obviously don't worry about generating those previews... just grab some thumbnail-sized images and plug them in.</li>
<li>Next, finish up by filling in some of the elements below the video -- the title, description and number of views.<br>Ignore the icons (many of them are produced using sprites or more advanced techniques so you won't be able to just grab them by copying them).</li>
<li>Push your solution up to GitHub.</li>
